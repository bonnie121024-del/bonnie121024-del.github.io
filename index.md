## MY Favorite CPSC120L Labs

* Lab 4 Part-2
Lab 4 Part 2 was one of my favorite labs, because the guessing game makes the programming interesting. Working through the guessing code allows me to have a better understanding of the guessing input, and how C++ works while we are creating the guessing code. When trying the output after sourcing the code, it makes me feel interested when all the tests past through.

* Lab 5
In this lab, I am able to learn how to use the unit test to check out if my program works in a correct way. I also gained experience on debugging C++ throughout the system and how each file in the project might work together. At the end of the assignment, I am able to gather together my correct format and output together to test out for my code.

* Lab 11
In this lab, me and my partner have a couple issue when we are processing through part 1. We are not able to find our error while testing our format. Therefore, it makes this lab interesting because it allow us to gather together and go through our code step by step and be able to realize where should we improve on either formatting or be more patient when we write out our code.
